# badXbasic
msbasic for the bad6502

This runs the KIM-1 basic rom from https://github.com/mist64/msbasic  
  
The code uses the bad6502 to simulate a bare KIM-1 just to run the BASIC code from 1977.  
Everything is intentionally kept as simple as posible.  

you need the badX16 repo checked out alongside this repo.
it uses the cpu/fake6502 files for running the 65c02.

### working are:
 - kim-1
 - OSI
 - Microtan

### buggy:
  - cbmbasic2
